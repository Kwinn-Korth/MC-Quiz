# MC-Quiz

## A basic, short, web development quiz

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I made this to help learn things like timers and how to switch between text
- I am still having a problem with the timer, but it does work
- times and saving to local storage can be tricky if your code is messy

## Usage
Anyone can use it, again, not sure why you would want to

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
